# Target Selector Macro:
Designed for 1.12.2, should work with older versions.

This macro is a overly complicated way to make target selectors, and it will show a gui menu to add the arguments to the target selector. All you need to do is put the script in a button/keybind. 

---

## Usage:
First, select either `@p,@r,@a,@e,@s`

Then, you can select the different arguments in a gui menu. If you do not know what the arguments does, double click on the argument and it will show you a short explanation. 

To add an argument, type the <argument>=<value> in the prompt gui. You can repeat this as many times as you want. For the `score_name` and `score_name_min` arguments, replace "name" with the score name. 

Finally, press escape to exit the menu, and it will log the target selector. You can customize it, and you can do anything with the `&output` variable.
